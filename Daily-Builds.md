- Daily builds allow you to test Nextcloud Client improvements, bugfixes and so on.
- You can find the daily builds on [in the desktop/daily folder of our download server](https://download.nextcloud.com/desktop/daily)
- The daily builds are based on the latest master. That means any feature or bugfix merged to master can be tested.
- The Windows compilation is done with the cmake option --config Debug - which should give you a better stack trace when an crash happens.
- _Before you install it, make sure to have a backup of your current settings._ Going back to the older version is likely to not work after you tried the new one.
- Keep in mind that this is a testing version: it could eat your data! :boom: 
- Please let us know about bugs you find in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues/new).
